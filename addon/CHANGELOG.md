- Ensure mode_name is topic safe

https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#discovery-topic

- Update quirks for H5051, H5103, H5179.

I believe this should fix both #188 and #206. It works locally for my H5179 devices.

- Deps: bump to latest versions

- Add more delays on startup

There's been a number of reports of things showing as unavailable
after a haos reboot, let's try to slow things down a bit in the
interest of hass more reliably accepting the registration.

It's frustrating because the various mqtt events are supposed
to be the signal that things are ready, and they aren't!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Insert blank scene/mode into list

This will prevent hass logging about the empty string being an invalid
mode for certain devices.

We report an empty string in cases where we don't know the state.

We obviously cannot set the scene to the empty string though,
so we will raise an error in that case.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- H7173: add quirk to note that it returns temperature in F

res: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/30

- Allow setting other temperature instances

The kettles have a different instance name than targetTemperature,
so allow setting that.

Reinstate decimal points in the computed temperature values to
avoid rounding/truncation issues compared to the govee app.

- H7173: show modes as "Activate Preset" buttons

I think these are a bit more accessible and intuitive, and allow
the user to rename the entity to match the names of the presets
in the app.

These buttons replace the original slider, which may still
function for folks upgrading, but won't be generated for
new installs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- H7130: device reports temp in F

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/69

- Speculatively support changing target temperature

For devices that report temperature settings, this commit
will now expose a number entity in Celsius that will change
the target temperature when set.

None of the govee device metadata I've see so far report
the current temperature target, so this entity works in
optimistic mode.

It's possible that hass will keep it greyed out until
a value is reported for it, which will be kinda sucky.

- Add Temperature Scale option

* *Important*: when upgrading from an earlier version,
  you should delete any devices that have temperature
  sensors or controls and then stop the addon/docker container
  and ensure that you have set the temperature scale to your
  preference, then start the addon/container again.

This commit introduces a configuration option to specify your
preferred temperature scale as either "C" or "F" for Celsius
or Fahrenheit, respectively.

Entities created in home assistant will be set to use those units,
and convert to the underlying device units.

Since I don't own any devices with this characteristics, this change
has not been tested with real devices and it may not work; please
file an issue if you're having trouble with this!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Fix "has no codec for TypeId" errors

We can resolve these by catching and ignoring the error from the encode
attempt; the only reason it can fail is if we don't know how to encode
for a given device.

The we fallback to whatever other strategy is available: most likely
it will be a platform API call.

## [2024.01.14-3c7b22d4] - 2024-01-15 01:08

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Add foundation for per-sku IoT/BLE packet parsing

- Adopt macro for defining packet codecs

This makes it much simpler and more declarative when defining
both the encode and decode operations for a packet.

- Add singleton PacketManager

- Add NotifyHumidifierMode parser for H7160

- Switch humidifier controls to new per-sku-iot codec

- Parallelize initial lan disco device querying

I noticed that sometimes one or two of my devices would show
up with a warning about not responding on the lan api yet.
I think this is a consequence of a couple devices being a
bit tardy, and since we were polling them sequentially, we
could run out of time (we allow 10 seconds before printing
the initial status) to hear from them.

This commit runs that polling in parallel.  It's possible
that this will need to be tweaked in the future to apply
a semaphore to limit just how many devices we're trying
to reach at once; for homes with a large number of govee
devices on the lan this might get a bit gnarly.

We'll see!

- Number entities logged a warning instead of an info entry when controlled via mqtt

- Remove need to duplicate struct field types in packetcodec definition

- Move SetSceneCode to PacketCodec

This is used to try to set scenes via the lan api

- Update test snapshots to match recent packet changes

- Remove old packet encoder/decoder

- Use 2 decimal places for temperature and humidity

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/68

- Publish temperature sensors in both C and F

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/68

- H7143: tweak available entities

Suppress the Auto level number entity; it is part of the humidity
entity.

Re-label "Manual".

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/22

- Make iot mqtt subscriber more robust

I was trying to improve debugging for reverse engineering purposes
and noticed that we were silently breaking.

What was happening was that the server was disconnecting us after
attempting to subscribe to device topic(s), and then the mqtt
client would leave our original subscription request hanging
indefinitely.

I've upgraded the mqtt client to cancel all pending waiters
on disconnect, and moved things around in here so that we can
catch and log this kind of error more assertively.

- Placeholder for iot-less humidifier control

Currently pointless when using the platform api

- Starting build legacy REST API client

The new platform API has a bunch of holes, and I'm hoping that
I can fill them with the old one.

- Add skeleton for old rest api

This is also write-only for appliances, and has less information
available than the platform API.

- Improve platform api support for Humidifiers

Where we don't have working IoT packet parsers for a humidifier,
we can fall back to the platform API.

Based on the capabilities reported for my device, that allows us
to report Manual mister level and mode, and to set (but not report)
the target humidity.

The write-only aspect of that API is a bit frustrating, but we
can set the entity up in optimistic mode and it seems to work
out OK in the hass UI.

Adjust the platform device polling to delay a few seconds before
polling; for my humidifier it takes a little bit for the API
to report the changed power state for my device if it was activated
as a side effect of setting the target humidity.

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/22
refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/49 (maybe)

- Suppress CapabilitySwitch warning about useless switch states

There are some switches for which Govee provides a useless
empty string for the status rather than the boolean switch or
toggle state.

There's no point warning about those; nobody other than Govee
can fix them.

- Adopt work mode parser in humidifier logic

- Add Mode select entity for appliances

For humidifiers this is redundant with the existing list of modes
reported there, but for other appliance devices that haven't been
nicely integrated (heaters, fans and so on), this should give
some control over the modes.

- Refine reporting of mode when iot is enabled

- Fix potential integer underflow with target humidity

I think that the 128+value thing is the MSB being set rather than
being an offset value.

I saw an underflow happen once during testing, but it didn't emit
a stack trace and has happened again since, which suggests to me
that the device may not always set that bit.

- It's ok for these new methods to not be used yet


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix updating mode select boxes

Need to use the name rather than the label for the mode.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Ci: add name to build.yml workflow

- Potentially fix temperature sensor scaling

This commit introduces temperature (and humidity) units awareness
to the quirks layer, and defines some quirks for a handful of
devices.

These quirks allow us to correctly interpret the sensor readings
returned from the platform API for these devices, which do not
have any other metadata available from Govee to aid with this.

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/56
refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/47

It may also help to avoid misinterpreting the device power state
with the rgb light state on devices that are not primarily
lights, such as certain kinds of space heaters and humidifiers,
and with some light strips.

Downgrade it to trace level so that it doesn't spam the logs or
mislead the user.

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/60

- Switch last-will to unretained

There are a couple of users who report that their devices appear
as offline in hass seemingly for no good reason.

As far as I can see from the logs, they both appear to otherwise
be in good working order.

One of them has troubles that correlate with restarting hass
itself and/or the broker addon.  It seems like there may not
be good connection recovery in that situation.

The other seems to have no issues at all, except that the availability
topic somehow reverts back to offline.

What I suspect is some kind of intermittent network burp that somehow
triggers the last will message to be sent by the broker.  I'm also
a bit dubious of the retained nature of that message: I've read a
few things online where folks are working around retained messages
that somehow end up in a sticky state.

So, this commit turns off the retained flag in the hope that we
don't see any additional weird reports like this going forwards.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix "devices not support this instance" error message

This was actually harmless, but noisy.  The cause was that Govee
API returns this error message when trying to list the available
scenes for the device. When I started this project the API returned
an empty list, but as of a few days ago they made it return an
error condition for devices that don't support scenes. We ignore
the error and continue, so it didn't harm anything, it was
just noisy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Include changelog in amended commit

- Add platform API metadata and state to Status entity attributes

Also add a "Request Platform API State" diagnostic button that
will force a query of the platform API state.

These can then be extracted from HASS and shared for troubleshooting
purposes using the template evaluation developer tools inside hass.

For example, this template reports both pieces of data for a specific
entity:

```
{{
{
  "meta": state_attr('sensor.smart_humidifier_status', 'platform_metadata'),
  "state": state_attr('sensor.smart_humidifier_status', 'platform_state'),
}
}}
```

- Add Status diagnostic to each device

It will indicate:

* `Available` - we've had a response from a poll request
  within the poll interval (approx 15 minutes)
* `Missing` - it's been longer than the poll interval
  (plus a little grace period) since we heard from the device.
* `Unknown` - we've never heard from the device

In addition, the following attributes are set on the entity:

* `iot` - the summarized device state based on the last
  response via IoT MQTT.
* `lan` - the summarized device state based on the last
  response via the LAN API
* `http` - the summarized device state basedon the last
  response via the Platform HTTP API
* `overall` - the most recent of `iot`, `lan`, `http`.

If any of the above are unknown, they will be null/missing
from the attributes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Refine messaging to highlight when setup may need attention

issue.

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/38

- Tweak waiting for settle message to show how many entities

- Consider "code" to be an alias for "status" in govee json responses

These aren't very consistent across the various endpoints :-/

- Add convenience method for HttpRequestFailed

Although I'm probably not going to use it in the immediate future

- Platform api now errors for my humidifier

It now yields:

```
{"requestId":"uuid","msg":"devices not support this instance","code":400,
```

which causes the previously cached-for-me empty results to be returned,
which is fine, but since this request failed it uses the negative ttl
of 1 minute, so we make this request every time we poll devices,
which is bad from an api quota limit perspective.

I could change the logic in the methods that fetch scenes to check
for this code and message string, but that seems brittle and error
prone.

So this commit takes a dual-pronged approach:

1. Bump the negative ttl to 5 minutes for any error in fetching scenes
2. Add in a quirk capability so that we know whether a device
   definitively does or does not support scenes and populate that
   for this particular device.  If we know it doesn't support them,
   we simply skip trying to populate scene metadata.

- Remove redundant Quirk label from startup diagnostics

the Debug impl will print it anyway, so this helps to make the
output less noisy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Add warning for weird work mode case

- Add read-after-write capability for platform api

There are a number of devices for which we don't know how to
fully decode data from the IoT API, but where the Platform API
will return us the data.

Contrive to read that data both in the periodic polls and also
to read it back after we've written a control request to the
device, so that we can more immediately reflect the new state.

## [2024.01.09-c452466f] - 2024-01-09 15:04

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Add basic support for humidifer nightlight via iot

This gets the nightlight working for me on my H7160

- This shows target humidity for my humidifier

There's no control over the parameters yet; the way they are
implemented in the govee device is awkward to map into home
assistant, so some gymnastics will be required.

- Introduce EntityList and EntityInstance

These will make it easier to manage the various entities.
Starting off with the simplest global version entity.

- SceneConfig to EntityInstance

- Light to EntityInstance

- SwitchConfig to EntityInstance

- Populate work number parameter entities

They are added as number entities.

They don't respond to changes from hass yet.

- Round out H7160 humidifier support

This seems to get things in a reasonably complete state for me:

* Night light power, color and brightness
* Target humidity percent shown in humidifier entity
* Manual mist level control

Custom is not mapped as an entity; it seems rather complex in
the UI and the metadata is no use in understand how to encode
those behaviors.

This might happen to enable other humidifiers as well,
but I wouldn't be surprised if they need additional care
and attention to work reasonably.

- Improve handling of undoc api

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/21

- Consider lan-api-support in a device as being a light

For devices that are not already known to be lan-api-capable
via our quirks database, if we detect them via lan-disco,
then we assume that they are in fact lights.

That said, in the linked issue, I don't think this would
have changed anything.

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/32

- Downgrade platform API trust when it conflicts with LAN API

If the Platform API says that the device isn't an rgb light,
but we have available LAN API, then we decide not to trust
the platform API for that device.

Again, I don't think this will change the outcome in
the linked issue because this primarily affects us
when trying to change scenes.

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/32

- Add log to indicate which technique was used to control device

So far, the absence of logging has meant that things were fine.
However, with multiple different choices for control, it makes
it difficult to suggest what to troubleshoot if a device doesn't
seem to respond.

This commit adds logging to show which strategy we used.

- Standardize on device.resolve_quirk()

It will synthesize some info in some cases, so we want to avoid
calling the raw resolve function.

- Check for LAN API connectivity on startup

Check and warn about possible LAN API configuration issues on startup.

- Allow for empty string when parsing embedded json

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Add http-control info subcommand

This shows the data about the device that we got back
from the platform api

- Segments: don't interpret OFF as level=0

It doesn't work very well:

* Some devices don't actully have 0 level brightness
  (https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/18) so they don't
  appear to turn off
* When doing light.turn_off for an area, setting segment levels
  has the side effect of turning the device back on, so the effect
  is that the light turns off and the immediately back on again.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Add segment color and brightness control

Since Govee doesn't report the status of individual segments,
the entities are registered with home assistant in optimistic
mode, meaning that what you last set via home assistant is what
it believes to be the state of the device.

This is likely sufficient for eg: capturing a scene in home assistant,
but you should not use the state of one of the segment lights to
make any kind of automation decisions.

- Add test running and other checks for prs

- Mark as unavailable when we disconnect from mqtt

- Allow configuring disco options via env vars

- Add some more docs

- Add note about privacy and data use

- Let's see if this builds on windows

- Windows: build on push

- Refine windows build bits

- Continuously release windows builds

- Don't do the release stuff on pr

- Only do release on tag

- Ignore spaces when parsing the scan env var

- Fallback to platform api if iot mqtt is not working

- Add more debug around disco

- Prep for addon

- Add missing global_broadcast option to addon config page

- Good enough for folks to try

- Add translations for addon

- Remove windows build

It's interesting to note that it builds, but I don't really
want to support it, and I don't think anyone will really need it.

- Add addon install docs

- Add support for DIY scenes

- Do a better job at filling out light metadata

brightness, rgb and color temp are now conditionally enabled
based on available metadata.

But: if we don't have any http metadata, we'll report no
capabilities at all. There's not much we can do about this
without having some kind of offline device metadata database
to consult.

- Adjust scene enumeration

Technically, scenes can be in the main device metadata; that's
what the docs show on one page, but on another they explain that
they factor it out into separate calls because it would otherwise
be too large.

The reality is that there are now three different places to look
and stitch things together, which is bit of a PITA.

- Add power switch for each light entity

Technically, this is redundant with the light itself, but the
thinking here is to allow for other kinds of devices that we
don't otherwise currently explicitly support.

- Only deny_unknown_fields in debug mode

- Cache: control stale reads on a per fetch basis

- Allow setting cache ttl based on fetched results

- Adjust ttls for credential caches

- Add new undoc api field

refs: https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/issues/6

- Improve error context around http requests

- Update test snapshot to go with f3eae71dff8f594e1230b8a7b5c5e7dfaa940d66

- Adjust for interesting govee schema

- Merge in SKU scene data when listing scenes

Today the Govee Platform API is only returning the first scene
from the full list.

Merge in what we can retrieve from the SKU light effect library
so that we're not completely broken by this.

- Lossless enum repr for the govee enum types

Rather than show as just `Other`, capture the full text
string version of the variant.

- Simplify the enum string bits with a macro

- Add "hub" entity to help group and find the other devices

Adds a "Govee to MQTT" virtual device and marks all others as being
connected via this device.

- Improve handling of commands the change multiple params at once

- Allow concurrent handling of mqtt commands

- Add music modes to the list of effects

There are a couple of caveats with this:

* Technically, the modes accept a color and sensitivity, but hass
  doesn't provide a great way to configure these values as part
  of its effects interface

* Due to layering, it's not super simple to expose these as
  eg: a number entity and a text entity; it is possible, but it
  is a bit more work than is perhaps needed immediately.

* Today, Govee seems to be having a data problem in the Platform
  API; a number of scenes are missing and there are only a subset
  of the total number of music modes being reported via the API.
  Hopefully they will fix this soon!  I've also noticed that the
  snapshot of the data I captured the other day doesn't 100%
  match the list of modes reported in the Govee App.

As for this commit: it simply defaults to automatic color and 100%
sensitivity when activating the effect.  It's likely good enough
for the moment.

- Remove stray debug

- Add quirks for H610A

At the time of writing, the platform API doesn't return correct
information for this device, and refuses to control it appropriately.

This commit adds the concept of a quirks database that can be used
to override the metadata and try to arrive at a better outcome.

This is sufficient to regain color and brightness control over this
device.

For scenes, this commit attempts to use the fruits of some reverse
engineering to compute a scene code to send via an undocumented
part of the LAN API.  In practice, this is most reliable with
scene codes that fit in a single byte; the others likely need
to get routed via the IoT MQTT connection.

That can be examined in a follow up commit.

- Redact email, key, password from run.sh output

- Explicitly manipulate the addon version number

I'd assumed that addons were versioned just like docker,
but they aren't.  You won't get an option to update if
it is just using "latest" all the time.

I suppose that makes sense for explicit point in time
releases, but it is a bit frustrating for continuous
delivery.

This commit adds a script to make it convenient to
explicitly tag and bump a version number.


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix some unused code warnings

- Fix some warnings

- Fix tables

- Fix 7z invocation

- Fix copypaste in docker-compose.yml

- Fixup de-reg and re-reg of entity configs on startup

I noticed that sometimes only the power switch was being
registered on startup.

Let's get a bit better at ordering of the config creates/deletes
and allowing settle time between each of the phases.


### üßπ Refactor

- Refactor to structure more like my pview project

- Refactor: move cache to own module

- Refactor scene+diy scene listing

- Refactor entity setup

Make it a bit easier to add different kinds of entities, and
generate entities for the various on_off and toggles reported
from the platform API.

Note however that the platform API doesn't return any useful
state for anything other than the light color and power state
at the time of writing, so this is a bit meh.
