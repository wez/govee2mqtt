configuration:
  temperature_scale:
    name: Temperature Scale
    description: >-
      Specify which temperature scale to use when mapping entities
      into Home Assistant. Can be either "C" for Celsius or "F" for Fahrenheit.
  govee_email:
    name: Govee Account Email
    description: >-
      The email address you registered with your Govee Account.
      Configuring this will cause govee2mqtt to require working
      internet connectivity on startup.
  govee_password:
    name: Govee Account Password
    description: >-
      The password you registered with your Govee Account
  govee_api_key:
    name: Govee API Key
    description: >-
      Functions that use the official Govee APIs require an API Key.
      If you don't already have one, you can find instructions on obtaining one
      at https://developer.govee.com/reference/apply-you-govee-api-key
      Configuring this will cause govee2mqtt to require working
      internet connectivity on startup.

  mqtt_host:
    name: MQTT Broker Host Name
    description: >-
      The host name or IP address of the MQTT Broker on your network.
      If you are using the Mosquitto Addon, you can leave this blank
      as it will be handled automatically by Home Assistant.
  mqtt_port:
    name: MQTT Broker Port Number
    description: >-
      The port number of the MQTT Broker on your network.
      If you are using the Mosquitto Addon, you can leave this blank
      as it will be handled automatically by Home Assistant.
  mqtt_username:
    name: MQTT Broker Username
    description: >-
      If your MQTT broker requires authentication, the username that
      should be used.
      If you are using the Mosquitto Addon, you can leave this blank
      as it will be handled automatically by Home Assistant.
  mqtt_password:
    name: MQTT Broker Password
    description: >-
      If your MQTT broker requires authentication, the password that
      should be used.
      If you are using the Mosquitto Addon, you can leave this blank
      as it will be handled automatically by Home Assistant.
  debug_level:
    name: Debug Filter
    description: >-
      If you need to troubleshoot, set this to a Rust debug level filter.
      The easiest value to enter for this is "govee=trace".
      Be aware that in trace mode some sensitive information will
      be output to the log. Take care to redact any topic or token
      strings before you paste and share it with others.
  no_multicast:
    name: Disable Multicast UDP Broadcast for LAN API Discovery
    description: >-
      If multicast-UDP doesn't work in your network, you can disable
      the use of the default multicast group 239.255.255.250. If
      you disable this, you should enable some of the other LAN
      discovery options.
  broadcast_all:
    name: Send discovery to each network interface
    description: >-
      If multicast-UDP doesn't work in your network, you may wish
      to enable this option. It will enumerate the non-loopback
      network interfaces on your system, and send a discovery packet
      to the broadcast address of each one.
  scan:
    name: Additional IPs and broadcast addresses to scan
    description: >-
      Enter a comma-separated list of IP addresses, broadcast
      addresses or multicast addresses to which to send discovery
      packets.  You can use this to list out the individual addresses
      of your Govee devices, assuming that they are configured with
      static IP addresses and that they are reachable from the
      home assistant machine.
  global_broadcast:
    name: Send discovery to global broadcast address
    description: >-
      If multicast-UDP doesn't work in your network, you may wish
      to enable this option. It will send discovery packets to the
      global broadcast address 255.255.255.255. To be honest, if
      multicast-UDP doesn't work, this isn't likely to work any
      better.
